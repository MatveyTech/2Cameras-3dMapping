<b><u>Dynamic programming:</u></b>
<br>
<p> Applied to algorithms which need to solve a problem by considering smaller sub-problems,<br/>
	but these sub-problems are often repeated across many different cases.
	By using some extra memory to remember the answers to already-seen answers,<br/>
	the run-time can be vastly decreased.</p>

<p>Our input (source image):</p>
	[P_src.jpg]<!--width:200px;Hight:200px-->
	<li><p>Given an image of an eye, convert its data to a 3d representation:<br/>
	X and Y axis are the coordinates and Z is the color data.</p></li>
	[P_3d_01.jpg]<!--width:300px;Hight:300px-->
	<li><p>Then the eye image is recursively divided into sectors to find the optimal eye partition.<br/>
	each sector is rotated parallel to X axis.</p></li>
	[P_rotated_slice_02.jpg]<!--width:600px;Hight:500px-->
	<li><p>Each sector is then recursively divided to find optimal number of segments and their position.</p></li>
	[P_figure_1.jpg]<!--width:300px;Hight:300px"-->
	<li><p>For each sector a plane that minimizes the distances of the (X,Y,Z) points from the plane is computed.</p></li>
	[P_3d_02.jpg]<!--width:300px;Hight:300px-->
	<li><p>A dynamic programing algorithm is used in order to calculate the optimal partition to k segments.</p></li>
	[P_optimal_division_elbow_graph.jpg]<!--width:400px;Hight:400px-->
	<li><p>In order to find the ideal number of partitions for the whole eye and for each sector (slice)<br/>
	a binary search is used to find the "elbow" point, <br/>
	the point that is farthest from the line that connects (1,f(1)) with (n,f(n))=(n,0),<br/>
	where (1,f(1)) is the sum of distances from the ideal plane of partition to 1 segment,<br/>
	and (n,f(n)) is the sum of distances from the ideal plane of partition to n segments.</p></li>
	<p><br/>Our output:</p>

<b><u>Imporvments to the original algorithm:</u></b><br>
<ol>
	<li>The code of the algorithm "the Shortest path with exactly k edges in a directed and weighted graph", <br/>
	was modified to python and combined into the project's code.</li>
	<li>Graph data set was created to support the 3d representation.</li>
	<li>The different stages explained in "Algorithm description" section were all implemented, <br/>
	including: 2d and 3d implemntation, modified binary search, combining algebraic regression,<br/>
	mathematical calculations(plane, distance from a point to a line, "finding the elbow point"). </li>
</ol>
