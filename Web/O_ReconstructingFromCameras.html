			<p><b>Input</b>br: Two Videos shot on 2 identical video cameras from 2 diffrent angles ( slight diffrance )</p>
			[P_src.jpg]
			<!--width:200px;Hight:200px-->
			<li>
				<p>Given an image of an eye, convert its data to a 3d representation:<br />
					X and Y axis are the coordinates and Z is the color data.</p>
			</li>
			[P_3d_01.jpg]
			<!--width:300px;Hight:300px-->
			<li>
				<p>Then the eye image is recursively divided into sectors to find the optimal eye partition.<br />
					each sector is rotated parallel to X axis.</p>
			</li>
			[P_rotated_slice_02.jpg]
			<!--width:600px;Hight:500px-->
			<li>
				<p>Each sector is then recursively divided to find optimal number of segments and their position.</p>
			</li>
			[P_figure_1.jpg]
			<!--width:300px;Hight:300px"-->
			<li>
				<p>For each sector a plane that minimizes the distances of the (X,Y,Z) points from the plane is computed.</p>
			</li>
			[P_3d_02.jpg]
			<!--width:300px;Hight:300px-->
			<li>
				<p>A dynamic programing algorithm is used in order to calculate the optimal partition to k segments.</p>
			</li>
			[P_optimal_division_elbow_graph.jpg]
			<!--width:400px;Hight:400px-->
			<li>
				<p>In order to find the ideal number of partitions for the whole eye and for each sector (slice)<br />
					a binary search is used to find the "elbow" point, <br />
					the point that is farthest from the line that connects (1,f(1)) with (n,f(n))=(n,0),<br />
					where (1,f(1)) is the sum of distances from the ideal plane of partition to 1 segment,<br />
					and (n,f(n)) is the sum of distances from the ideal plane of partition to n segments.</p>

			<b><u>Imporvments to the original algorithm:</u></b><br>
			<ol>
				<li>The code of the algorithm "the Shortest path with exactly k edges in a directed and weighted graph", <br />
					was modified to python and combined into the project's code.</li>
				<li>Graph data set was created to support the 3d representation.</li>
				<li>The different stages explained in "Algorithm description" section were all implemented, <br />
					including: 2d and 3d implemntation, modified binary search, combining algebraic regression,<br />
					mathematical calculations(plane, distance from a point to a line, "finding the elbow point"). </li>
